# Tree-Based-Models-for-Multi-Domain-ML
A comparative study of Decision Trees and XGBoost across classification and regression tasks using datasets from car evaluation, brain cancer detection, wage prediction, and credit risk analysis.


This project explores and compares Decision Tree and XGBoost algorithms on a variety of supervised learning tasks, including binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression. Four real-world datasets are used across domains such as car evaluation, brain cancer detection, wage prediction, and credit scoring. The project includes preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning via validation sets, and evaluation using standard metrics. The goal is to analyze performance trade-offs between simple tree models and ensemble-based boosting methods in diverse machine learning contexts.
